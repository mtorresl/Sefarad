[Sefarad](http://gsi.dit.upm.es) 
==================================

Introduction
---------------------
Sefarad is an application developed to explore data by making SPARQL queries to the endpoint you choose without writing more code. You can also create your own cores if you have a big collection of data (LMF required).
To view your data you can customize your own widgets and visualize it through them.

Installation instructions
------------------------------
Every time you create a new widget you have to update Sefarad. Once you have created the widget and have placed it in your widget's directory ('.js/widgets/' by default), execute 'node app' and the file 'sefarad.html' will be uplaoded with all the widgets.
